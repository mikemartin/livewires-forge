Live Wires Mixture
=========

Live Wires is a simple in-browser wireframing toolkit. This is my Mixture boilerplate for it.

This is my answer to all the crappy wireframing tools and over-complicated prototype libraries out there.

Live Wires is simple HTML & CSS. It doesn't try to be fancy. It doesn't look like a final design, but it also doesn't look like dog doo like other wireframing tools. Most text is represented by background images. It is designed to be a starting point for production code, not something you throw out. It's also very fast to work with once you get the hang of it. It is more of a philosophy than a product.

This Mix also includes a style guide template and some starter components to help assist with in-browser prototyping, content development, and design.
