team to manage content. Empowering, right? Something we love most — 
and we know you will, too — is the intuitive WordPress dashboard.

content is decoration."

more. Yes, it is as impressive as it sounds

## Responsive Web Design
The easier it is for users to get your content how and where they want it, 
the better your site will perform. In today’s world full of distractions and 
information overload, you either adapt or get tuned out.

# Service Detail

## Wordpress CMS Development
We believe in WordPress and its open source community so much that 
we’re contributors. This means we’re part of a core team of WordPress 
elves donating our time and skills to its ongoing development. Merry 
Christmas, everyone! 

WordPress makes it possible for us to build your site and equip your 
team to manage content. Empowering, right? Something we love most — 
and we know you will, too — is the intuitive WordPress dashboard. Once 
we tailor it to your needs, we promise your team will find adding and 
updating content a cinch.

took the pain out of digital. 

## UX Design & Content Strategy
The beauty of user experience (UX) design and content strategy is the 
value they add regardless of budget size. Involving users in the design 
process and having the right content strategy will help you build a 
website with content that meets business goals and user needs. Ready to 
delight your audience? 

We bring foundational UX design and sound content strategy to every 
project. Because, afterall, as Jeffrey Zeldman said, "Design without 
content is decoration." 

[Company X] saw a rise in profits when we wrote calls to action that were 
more clear and compelling. (link to project story) 
 
## Custom Web Design
Be a digital Lady Gaga with a site unique to you — let us create 
something to set you apart and make you hard to forget. We'll work with 
Style Tiles to bring your brand to the web in a structured way, with loads 
of creative options.

## Future-Friendly Web Development
It’s impossible to create something future-proof since no one can predict 
the future of digital. But, as creators, we can embrace the ever-changing 
landscape and be future-friendly. We approve all forms of friendly. 
We work hard to stay on the leading edge of development best practices. 
HTML5, grid systems, page load optimization, script minimizing, and 
more. Yes, it is as impressive as it sounds.

## Responsive Web Design
It's not just a buzzword. It's about accessibility — and that's a must. 
Ready or not, your audience is interacting with your site on devices that 
likely didn’t exist when it was a baby.

The easier it is for users to get your content how and where they want it, 
the better your site will perform. In today’s world full of distractions and 
information overload, you either adapt or get tuned out. Looks like 
Darwin got some things right.

## Search Engine Optimization
While useful, quality content is some of the best SEO, we’ve got other 
tools in our belt to give your site better visibility. We’ll use keywords and 
some Google magic to supercharge your search results. 

We understand the abilities and limitations of search engines so you 
don’t have to. We’ll build, format and annotate your content in a way that 
makes sense to search engines. Without SEO, your website will be 
invisible — and that’s one superpower we want to help you avoid.

performance. 
 
 
## API Integrations
We work with you to integrate internal services with your website. Pardon? 

Think about buying movie tickets online: you enter your credit card 
information without leaving the site. That’s because the movie ticket site 
uses an API to verify your information remotely. Once everything jives, 
the remote application tells the movie ticket site that things are a go, and 
you get your tickets. 

API Integration means applications working together behind the scenes 
to provide seamless web experiences. And we can create those 
experiences for your site! 
 
Check out how we used API Integrations to sync PGX’s information and 
eliminated the need manage it in two places. 
 
## CRM Integrations and Marketing Automation
Imagine if your Rolodex could fill itself out for you? Well now it can! 
Except we don’t call it a Rolodex these days — it goes by CRM (customer 
relationship management). And it’s way prettier. We can integrate your 
website with your CRM of choice to automatically collect valuable 
customer data. Best part? It can’t fall off your desk or get dusty! 
Want your customers to become loyal customers and — better yet — 
company evangelists? Yes, please! 

Marketing automation to the rescue! Good marketing automation treats 
customers like real people and uses data to understand customer needs 
and wants. It offers information they need, when and where they need it 
to make decisions they’ll feel good about. Let us show you how. Take a look at the drip campaign we set up for [Company N].
